# A Simple WiFi Scanner. This will scan for all detectable WiFi networks in range on the PC. 
# It will capture the name, SID, signal strength, frequenciy and security)
# You can expand this to store in a SQLite DB and record and trend over time. 
# Add detected data and maybe add the network you are currently connected to 
# If you are mobile with a laptop. 

# pywifi kept throwing unrecognized error although it was installed, added the ignore, works fine.
# Note - when you pip install pywifi and run it, you may get can't find comtypes. Pip install comtypes seperate.
